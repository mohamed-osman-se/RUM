# RUM – Anonymous Messaging App
RUM (Receive Unknown Messages) is a production-ready web application that allows users to create accounts, generate public links, and receive anonymous messages securely.

This project was built to demonstrate **real-world backend engineering practices**, focusing on clean architecture, security, background processing, and maintainability.

---

## Live Demo

**URL:** https://rum.runasp.net/

> **Note:**  
> The application is deployed on a **free trial hosting service**.  
> As a result, the app may occasionally be unavailable, partially functional, or experience cold starts due to hosting limitations.

## Project Motivation

The goal of this project is to showcase how I design and implement a **scalable, secure backend system** similar to what would be expected in a professional production environment.

Key focus areas:
- Authentication and session management
- Abuse prevention and rate limiting
- Background processing
- Clean and maintainable architecture
- Containerized deployment

---

## Core Features

- User registration and authentication (cookie-based sessions)
- Public profile links to receive anonymous messages
- Anonymous message submission without authentication
- Automatic message deletion after 24 hours using a background service
- Rate limiting to mitigate spam and abuse
- Structured logging for observability
- Repository pattern for clean data access
- Dockerized deployment for consistent environments
